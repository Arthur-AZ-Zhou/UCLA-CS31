For the initial run, I put in 1000 voters with 369 votes for Gavin and 631 votes for Brian, leading to 36.9% of votes for Gavin and 63.1% of votes for Brian
I then input 1 surveyed voter and said that 3 voted for Gavin and none voted for Brian, resulting in 300% of the voters saying they will vote for Gavin
and 0% voting for Brian which is clearly nonsensical because you can't have 300% of a population vote for a candidate.

For the logic_error.cpp, instead of double pctGavin = 100.0 * forGavin / numberSurveyed;, I put in an integer instead of the double (I did the same with 
Brian's percentage). It works if you have like let's say 10 voters and 6 voted for Gavin and 4 voted for Brian (a 60% 40% split), but if you had
the initial scenario with 36.9% of voters for Gavin and 63.1% for Brian, pctGavin and pctBrian would omit the decimal, leading to a 36% and 63% ratio which
doesn't add up to 100.

For the compile_error.cpp, I removed a semicolon from int numberSurveyed and put a colon after the if else statement (like they do in Python). I thought that 
a new coder would make these mistakes such as forgetting a semicolon or if they transitioned from another language like Python they would enter in the 
wrong syntax on accident. As a result of this, there were 5 compiler errors: one where the next line had an error because the previous one had no closing
semicolon, and since numberSurveyed wasn't closed the variable wasn't defined either. And because of that since int forGavin was affected by the lack of 
the semicolon, that variable wasn't defined either. Finally there were 2 unexpected expressions: the colons after the if and else statements.
