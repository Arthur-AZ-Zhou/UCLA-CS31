a. The most notable obstacle for me was trying to mentally think about the path of the if statements I were to use. I considered having an integer
that labels the income as one of 3 scenarios: lower than 55k, between 55k and 120k, and above 120k. I then realized that I didn't have to make
the scenario variable if I simply just checked in the main if statement loop itself. It took me a solid 20 minutes to think of my main if, else if, and else
part of my code. Other than that, it was smooth sailing.

b. 
Template for what I'm about to enter: (income, occupation, # of children) = $amtOwed
(10000, engineer, 0) = $400, checks if the tax for first bracket is right
(10000, nurse, 1) = $200, makes sure nurses/teachers dont get discount in first bracket, also checks child situation
(10000, bus driver, 3) = $0, makes sure amtOwed can't go below 0
(90000, engineer, 2) = $4250, makes sure 2nd bracket not nurse/teacher works
(90000, teacher, 12) = $1550, checks for teacher/nurse scenario in second bracket
(250000, businessman, 9) = $18725, checks for above 2nd bracket
(250000, nurse, 9) = $17325, checks for above 2nd bracket but is nurse/teacher
My code is able to handle each test case correctly unless there's an invalid input.
